<h1>ecall</h1>

<p>Makes a request to the supporting execution environment.
When executed in U-mode, S-mode, or M-mode, it generates an environment-call-from-U-mode
exception, environment-call-from-S-mode exception, or environment-call-from-M-mode
exception, respectively, and performs no other operation.

[NOTE]
ECALL generates a different exception for each originating privilege mode so that
environment call exceptions can be selectively delegated.
A typical use case for Unix-like operating systems is to delegate to S-mode
the environment-call-from-U-mode exception but not the others.

ECALL causes the receiving privilege mode&#39;s epc register to be set to the address of
the ECALL instruction itself, not the address of the following instruction.
As ECALL causes a synchronous exception, it is not considered to retire,
and should not increment the `minstret` CSR.
