<h1>ebreak</h1>

<p>The EBREAK instruction is used by debuggers to cause control to be transferred back to
a debugging environment. Unless overridden by an external debug environment,
EBREAK raises a breakpoint exception and performs no other operation.

[NOTE]
As described in the `C` Standaxd Extension for Compressed Instructions, the `c.ebreak`
instruction performs the same operation as the EBREAK instruction.

EBREAK causes the receiving privilege mode&#39;s epc register to be set to the address of
the EBREAK instruction itself, not the address of the following instruction.
As EBREAK causes a synchronous exception, it is not considered to retire,
and should not increment the `minstret` CSR.
